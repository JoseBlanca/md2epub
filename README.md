# md2epub
Creates an epub3 or an html site from a buch of markdown files.

I plan to use this code in a book that I'm writing, if you're interested in using it, just do it or send me a message if you want.

It handles citations using citeproc.

There are still features not supported (or at least not checked), because I don't need them right now.
The most prominent one if you're thinking on using this for a technical book is images. But I guess that it would be very ease to add them.

I haven't add support for notes. It already supports bibliographic endnotes, so I guess that it would be very easy to add them.
